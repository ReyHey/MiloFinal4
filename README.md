We use GitHub for Version Control, in order to use the GitHub for this project, LFS(Large File Storage). in this project, we are using GitHub desktop and the Git bash to push, pull and do the branch management. 
### Playing the game

### Credits
This Project and game has been made in collaboration by group 15. The group has 4 members, with them being, Brandon, Parastoo, Rey and Ryan. Each of the different members knows how all parts of the project work, but the game itself has each part done primarily by one or two people. 

#### Third party assets, libaries etc. 
For version control we have made use of Git LFS, which is a way to use Git with larger files, up to 100mb, due to the fact that Unity does make use of larger files. 

### Running the game
In order to play the game on a Windows based Operating system, you have to run the .exe file that is inside the root folder. 


### Troubleshooting and known issues in the game
Here we will put issues that we know exists in the program that we do acknowledge, but due to a multitude of reason, such as time constraints, and due to the the amount of benefit we gain compared to the time spent on doing. 
#### List of known problems.
